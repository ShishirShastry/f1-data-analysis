# F1 Data Analysis Project

The Formula 1 Data Analysis project is a comprehensive exploration of the world of Formula 1 racing through the lens of data analytics. This project combines the power of SQL for data manipulation and Tableau for data visualisation to provide insights into the thrilling world of Formula 1 racing from 1953-2020.

## Key Components:

Data Collection and Preparation: The project begins by gathering extensive Formula 1 data, including race results, driver statistics, team information, and circuit details. This raw data is then cleaned and organised for analysis.

Database Design: A relational database is created using SQL to efficiently store and manage the Formula 1 data. This step includes defining tables, relationships, and constraints to ensure data integrity.

SQL Data Queries: SQL queries are crafted to extract meaningful insights from the database. This may involve calculating driver and team performance metrics, historical trend analysis, and identifying key patterns in the data.

Tableau Visualisation: The SQL-derived insights are visualised using Tableau, a powerful data visualisation tool, and Deepnote. Interactive dashboards and reports are designed to provide users with a user-friendly interface to explore the data.

Performance Analysis: Using SQL and Tableau, the project delves into various aspects of Formula 1 racing, such as driver performance across seasons, race track statistics, and the impact of rule changes.

Reporting and Presentation: The project concludes by creating comprehensive reports and presentations that summarise the findings, making it accessible to a wider audience.

## Benefits:

Gain a deeper understanding of Formula 1 racing from a data-driven perspective.

Enhance the overall Formula 1 fan experience by making complex data accessible and engaging.

This project offers a unique opportunity to combine the technical skills of SQL with the data visualisation capabilities of Tableau to unlock insights about one of the dynamic sports in the world.
